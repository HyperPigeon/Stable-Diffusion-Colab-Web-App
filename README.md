# Stable Diffusion Web App for Google Colab
A simple web app for generating images with stable diffusion models using Google Colab. 

### A few things to know:
- Set runtime type in Colab to GPU.
- You can easily change the SD model by changing the `model_id`.
- You will have to create an ngrok account if you don't already have one. 
- You can either drop templates directly into your runtime environment, or read it from your Google drive.
